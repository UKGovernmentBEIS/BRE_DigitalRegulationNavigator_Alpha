# BEIS DRN Alpha Technical Documentation

[TOC]

## Project overview

!!! note
We used [Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) for the purpose of Alpha and due to unknown on the editorial content needs.
There is no expectation or recommendation to continue using Wagtail in the next phases.

This is a GDS Alpha-phase exploration for the BEIS Digital Regulation Navigator (DRN) project.

To work on this project, see the README.

### External integrations

- [Companies House API](https://developer.company-information.service.gov.uk/api/docs/)
- [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/)

## Adding documentation

A navigational index of the documentation files is in the mkdocs.yml file. Add any new markdown files to that index. You can also link directly to files where necessary, using markdown formatting and relative URLs.

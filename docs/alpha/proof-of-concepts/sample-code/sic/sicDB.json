      "title": "MANUFACTURING",
      "detail": "This section includes the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing (see remark on processing of waste below). The materials, substances, or components transformed are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing activities. Substantial alteration, renovation or reconstruction of goods is generally considered to be manufacturing.<BR><BR>The output of a manufacturing process may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilisation or consumption, or it may be semi-finished in the sense that it is to become an input for further manufacturing. For example, the output of alumina refining is the input used in the primary production of aluminium; primary aluminium is the input to aluminium wire drawing; and aluminium wire is the input for the manufacture of fabricated wire products.<BR><BR>Manufacture of specialised components and parts of, and accessories and attachments to, machinery and equipment is, as a general rule, classified in the same class as the manufacture of the machinery and equipment for which the parts and accessories are intended. Manufacture of unspecialised components and parts of machinery and equipment, e.g. engines, pistons, electric motors, electrical assemblies, valves, gears, roller bearings, is classified in the appropriate class of manufacturing, without regard to the machinery and equipment in which these items may be included. However, making specialised components and accessories by moulding or extruding plastics materials is included in group ##22.2.<BR><BR>Assembly of the component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing. This includes the assembly of manufactured products from either self-produced or purchased components.<BR><BR>The recovery of waste, i.e. the processing of waste into secondary raw materials is classified in group ##38.3 (Materials recovery). While this may involve physical or chemical transformations, this is not considered to be a part of manufacturing. The primary purpose of these activities is considered to be the treatment or processing of waste and they are therefore classified in Section ##E (Water supply; sewerage, waste management and remediation activities). However, the manufacture of new final products (as opposed to secondary raw materials) is classified in manufacturing, even if these processes use waste as an input. For example, the production of silver from film waste is considered to be a manufacturing process.<BR><BR>Specialised maintenance and repair of industrial, commercial and similar machinery and equipment is, in general, classified in division ##33 (Repair, maintenance and installation of machinery and equipment). However, the repair of computers and personal and household goods is classified in division ##95 (Repair of computers and personal and household goods), while the repair of motor vehicles is classified in division ##45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).<BR><BR>The installation of machinery and equipment, when carried out as a specialised activity, is classified in ##33.20.<BR><BR>Remark: The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurred. As a general rule, the activities in the manufacturing section involve the transformation of materials into new products. Their output is a new product. However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective. As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in SIC:<UL><LI>fresh fish processing (oyster shucking, fish filleting), not done on a fishing boat (see ##10.20)<LI>milk pasteurising and bottling (see ##10.51)<LI>leather converting (see ##15.11)<LI>wood preserving (see ##16.10)<LI>printing and related activities (see ##18.1)<LI>tyre retreading (see ##22.11)<LI>ready-mixed concrete production (see ##23.63)<LI>electroplating, plating, and metal heat treating (see ##25.61)<LI>rebuilding or remanufacturing of machinery (e.g. automobile engines, see ##29.10)</UL><BR>Conversely, there are activities that, although sometimes involving transformation processes, are classified in other sections of SIC; in other words, they are not classified as manufacturing. They include:<UL><LI>logging, classified in section ##A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);<LI>beneficiating of agricultural products, classified in section ##A (Agriculture, forestry and fishing);<LI>preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division ##56 (Food and beverage service activities)<LI>beneficiating of ores and other minerals, classified in section ##B (Mining and quarrying);<LI>construction of structures and fabricating operations performed at the site of construction, classified in section ##F (Construction);<LI>activities of breaking bulk and redistribution in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; sorting of scrap; mixing paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order; treatment not resulting into a different good is classified to section ##G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles).</UL>"

      "title": "Manufacture of food products",
      "detail": "This division includes the processing of the products of agriculture, forestry and fishing into food for humans or animals, and includes the production of various intermediate products that are not directly food products. The activity often generates associated products of greater or lesser value (for example, hides from slaughtering, or oilcake from oil production).This division is organised by activities dealing with different kinds of products: meat, fish, fruit and vegetables, fats and oils, milk products, grain mill products, animal feeds and other food products. Production can be carried out for own account, as well as for third parties, as in custom slaughtering. Some activities are considered manufacturing (for example, those performed in bakeries, pastry shops, and prepared meat shops etc. which sell their own production) even though there is retail sale of the products in the producers&#39; own shop. However, where the processing is minimal and does not lead to a real transformation, the unit is classified to wholesale and retail trade (section ##G).Preparation of food for immediate consumption on the premises is classified to division ##56 (Food and beverage service activities).Production of animal feeds from slaughter waste or by-products is classified in ##10.9, while processing food and beverage waste into secondary raw material is classified to ##38.3, and disposal of food and beverage waste in ##38.21. This division does not include the preparation of meals for immediate consumption, such as in restaurants."

For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in division ##16 (Manufacture of wood and wood products). However, the multiple processes distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing. Similarly, metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacturing of roll-formed products classified in division ##25 (Manufacture of fabricated metal products).
